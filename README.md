**Introduction** 

Hello! Prior to our semester being cut short, I had planned on creating a map quiz of the entire United States. 
Yet, due to COVID-19, I wasn't able to learn all of the necessary skills required to complete this task. So, 
I completed an around-the-world of my life! By utilizing Mappa, a p5.js library, I was able to complete this.
Each red point signifies a place that has importance in my life! 

**Instructions** 

The instructions are relatively simple! Click on each red point, view the picture, read the text, and 
enjoy a glimpse into my world!
